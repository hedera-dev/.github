## Intro

Hedera Developers is the umbrella for tutorials, tools, and production-grade templates that help you move from zero to mainnet on Hedera. Whether you're experimenting with Hashgraph-native services like the Token Service (HTS) or deploying Solidity on the Hedera EVM, this repo is your starting index.

*⚡️ Why Hedera?*

* Predictably low fees for every transaction
* Finality in seconds on a carbon-negative ledger
* Native tokenization, consensus, and smart-contract services
