## Hedera Developers

Hi there ðŸ‘‹!

This github organisation contains many repos that are dedicated to anyone developing on Hedera.

This is where you can find code snippets,
examples, workshops, demo applications, proofs of concept, et cetera.

What you will **not** find here are production-grade applications,
or anything that could be used as a dependency in them.
The aim here is to educate, and show you what is possible!

Maintained by your friendly DevRel team! ðŸ˜Š
